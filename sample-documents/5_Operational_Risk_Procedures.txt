4. Document lessons learned
5. Update risk register
6. Implement corrective actions
7. Monitor effectiveness

4. RISK ASSESSMENT METHODOLOGY
------------------------------

Level 4 - Major ($250K-$1M)
- Major process failure
- Significant customer impact
- Regulatory fine likely

Level 5 - Severe (>$1M)
- Critical process failure
- Mass customer defection risk
- Major regulatory action

4.2 Likelihood Assessment Scale

Level 1 - Rare
- Less than once in 5 years
- Probability <10%

Level 2 - Unlikely
- Once in 2-5 years
- Probability 10-30%

Level 3 - Possible
- Once in 1-2 years
- Probability 30-50%

Level 4 - Likely
- Multiple times per year
