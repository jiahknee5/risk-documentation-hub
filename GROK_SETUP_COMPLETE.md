## Features Working with Grok

- ✅ AI-enhanced search responses
- ✅ Risk management context understanding
- ✅ Document summarization
- ✅ Compliance framework detection
- ✅ Banking terminology analysis

## Cost Considerations

Grok pricing is based on tokens used. With current settings:
- ~500 tokens per search query
- Approximately $0.002-0.005 per search
- Monitor usage at https://x.ai/api

## Switching AI Providers

To switch between providers, just update the environment variables:

### Use OSS-GPT (Self-hosted)
```bash
AI_PROVIDER="oss-gpt"
OSS_GPT_BASE_URL="http://your-server:8080"
```

### Use OpenAI
```bash
AI_PROVIDER="openai"
OPENAI_API_KEY="sk-your-key"
```

### Disable AI
```bash
AI_PROVIDER="disabled"
```

## Security Notes

- API keys are stored securely in environment variables
- Never commit API keys to git
- .env is in .gitignore for safety
- Vercel stores environment variables encrypted
