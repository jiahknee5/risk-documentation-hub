# Navigation Fix Summary

## Problem
The buttons on the dashboard and throughout the site were not working. Users were getting stuck on pages with no way to navigate between sections.

## Root Causes
1. Dashboard "Quick Actions" buttons were plain `<button>` elements without any navigation functionality
2. No navigation menu existed on any pages - users had no way to move between pages
3. The root layout didn't include any shared navigation component

## Solution Implemented

### 1. Created Shared Navigation Component
- Created `/src/components/Navigation.tsx` with full navigation menu
- Includes links to all main pages: Dashboard, Documents, Search, Users, Audit
- Shows current user information and sign out button
- Highlights the active page
- Fully responsive with mobile menu

### 2. Fixed Dashboard Quick Actions
- Added `useRouter` hook to dashboard
- Implemented `onClick` handlers on all Quick Action buttons:
  - "Upload Document" → navigates to `/documents`
  - "Search Documents" → navigates to `/search`
  - "View Audit Trail" → navigates to `/audit`

### 3. Added Navigation to All Pages
Updated every page to include the Navigation component:
- Dashboard (`/dashboard`)
- Documents (`/documents`)
- Search (`/search`)
- Users (`/users`)
- Audit (`/audit`)

## Testing the Fix

After deployment completes (2-3 minutes), test the navigation:

1. Go to https://risk.johnnycchung.com
2. Log in with any demo account (e.g., admin@example.com / password123)
3. You should see the navigation menu at the top of every page
4. Click any link in the navigation to move between pages
5. On the dashboard, click the Quick Action buttons - they should navigate correctly

## Technical Details

### Navigation Component Features
- Uses Next.js `Link` component for client-side navigation
- `usePathname` hook to detect current page
- Conditional styling for active links
- Session-aware (only shows when user is logged in)
- Sign out functionality integrated

### Code Changes
- Modified 6 page components to include Navigation
- Created 1 new component (Navigation.tsx)
- Added proper routing to dashboard buttons
- All changes are backwards compatible

The navigation should now work perfectly on the deployed site!
